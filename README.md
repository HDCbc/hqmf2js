This project is a library that will convert the declarative HQMF measure descriptions produced by the NQF Measure Authoring Tool into executable JavaScript suitable for use
within the popHealth Quality Measure Engine.


Project Practices
=================

Please try to follow our [Coding Style Guides](http://github.com/eedrummer/styleguide). Additionally, we will be using git in a pattern similar to [Vincent Driessen's workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). While feature branches are encouraged, they are not required to work on the project.
